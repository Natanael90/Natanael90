<p>I'm getting a hang of how to use Jekyll and Github Pages now. Soon it will be time to start importing all of my old content from my old blog over to this place.</p>

<p>Given that this is based on Git, static files and an open source site generator and server software, I can always just move to another host if github tanks. So this should be my most future proof solution yet for publishing my thoughts.</p>
