<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>These pages will be updated over time, serving as a mix of blog and public notepad. It will primarily be used as a place to collect my thoughts, ideas and interests in a public space, in the hope that something might turn out to be useful.</p>

<p>The site's still under construction. Expect intermittent re-theming and URLs suddenly breaking in the near future.</p>
